# AIMS
Alcohol Inventory Managment System Project for Code Kentucky

### Project objective:

  - Track the quantity and value of a business's alcohol inventory.

### Statement of Work:  

  - Gather inventory into a csv file and value of each unique product.

  - I plan to implement the following commands:

  	-Red Add Product - Save name of new product and cost of unit.
	- Green Remove Product - Remove product name and cost. 
	- Track Inventory - Input quantity of a product at the current time by tenths of a bottle.
	- Edit - Retrieve current or previous copies of stored inventory numbers and adjust specific product quantities.  
	- Report - Access a summary of inventory levels, value of inventory and compare to previous inventories. 
	- Exit - Close the program.

## Features you are integrating into your project:

### Feature 1: 
	
  - implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions,
	including choosing to exit the program
	
### Feature 2:
	
  - Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
	
### Feature 3:
	
  - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
	
### Feature 4:
	
  - Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
	
  - If time permits, I plan to implement additional functionality such as a LINQ query and unit test as a stretch goal.
